CLI is a general purpose command line interface library.

CLI allows programmers to define access from command line to
arbitrary functions. Users can then call the functions from command
line without having to modify the program itself. Variadic functions

CLI is implemented in C using GNU readline.

The library comes along with CLIdemo which is a pretty good example
of how to use CLI from C.


TODO
====

 - Use readline only from terminal, otherwise use stdio.

 - Completion. Tab completion of commands is not yet supported.

 - Typed patterns. Instead of just prefix command names, also allow for
   command typed patterns to denote function application. For instance
   "(int) + (int)" denotes infix integer addition.
   See http://dot-do-lang.kmx.io/ for more information about typed
   patterns.
